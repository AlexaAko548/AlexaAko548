### 3rd Year IT Student | Tech Enthusiast & Creative Problem Solver

I am an IT student from the University of San Carlos with a passion for building end-to-end digital solutions. I love exploring how technology connects, from designing intuitive interfaces to writing code and managing the systems that keep it all running. I enjoy wearing multiple hats and understanding the full picture of how software comes to life.
